Hyperdocs uses [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) at various parts of the stack to notify users.

This is because:

- Hyperdocs is an open-source project that's not monetized, and all the email services out there have a cost.
- Web3Forms is a free service that's easy to use and has a generous free plan.
