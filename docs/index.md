Hyperdocs is the simplest way you can create documentation for your project. It blends the best of all the other documentation tools in one.

Hyperdocs requires no configuration and yet is highly customizable. You just need to have a bunch of markdown files in a `/docs` directory and Hyperdocs will take care of the rest.
