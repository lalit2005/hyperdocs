Hyperdocs is the simplest way you can create documentation sites for your project on GitHub.

Hyperdocs requires no configuration and yet is highly customizable. You just need to have a bunch of Markdown (`.md`) files in a `/docs` directory and Hyperdocs will generate a blazing fast website from them and host it for you.

Here are some of the amazing features of Hyperdocs:

- **No configuration** required.
- **No rebuilds** or dealing with hosting providers needed.
- Built-in **blog** for your project.
- **Premade components** for your docs such as callouts, tooltips, React live code preview, etc., all inside Markdown.
- Built in **feedback collection widget**.
- Ability to add **custom domains**/subdomains for your site.
- Super fast documentation and blogs hosted on edge on **Netlify**.
- Use different themes and plugins to enhance the look and feel of your documentation.
- A beautiful homepage that can be customized.
- Auto-updating docs site that fetches content from a GitHub repo periodically.
- Dark mode for all pages.
- Ability to use JSX inside Markdown.
